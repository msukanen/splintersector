# SplinterSector

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and a `KtxApplicationAdapter`
extension.

## State of Things

Currently, **SplinterSector** is purely a test platform for [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) and doesn't
represent the eventual, actual game, in any shape or form.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3.
- `server`: A separate application without access to the `core` module.

# Server
<W.I.P. eventually>
